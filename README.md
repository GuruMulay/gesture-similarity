### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains the data and code for calculating similarity of gestures performed with and without sound. 
This is the calculation of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors and using the mean of the first principal angle to find the similarity.
Mean and the standard deviation are the measures used for analysis. 

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Extract the repository. It contains the code and the data in it. The data is the numpy files (for pure data, eigenvectors and eigenvalues).
2. Set the path of the destination directory, or the data directory (not required if already set or unnecessary)
3. Run the gesture-similarity.py file in the tests folder.
